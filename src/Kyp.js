            <p>
              People who tend to fall near the extrovert end of the spectrum
              draw their energy from the outside world: the people, places, and
              things around them.{"\n"}

                  Extroverted people tend to feel most comfortable when working
                  with other people, whether the task is a work project, party
                  planning with friends, or a school assignment.

                  Extroverts tend to take action rather than ponder. Once you
                  decide to do something, you usually just go for it without
                  worrying too much about what might happen.{" "}

                  If you’re introverted, socializing can drain your natural
                  energy reserves, so you prefer to listen and absorb what’s
                  happening around you.

            <h1>Intuition and Senseing</h1>
            <h2>What it means to be Intuitive : </h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                Intuitives are out-of-the-box thinkers who use their intuition
                to think more about what something could be. Of course
                intuitives use their five senses as well, because our bodies and
                brains are all designed to do that, but they're interested in
                more than just what their senses tell them. They start with the
                big picture and work back to the details. They have more of a
                future orientation, and so as they take in new information they
                use it to shine a light on where they're headed. They live in a
                world of possibilities and tend to embrace change.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Similarly, those who use intuition are more open-minded in
                nature and therefore, they welcome the new possibilities in life
                while also accepting the novelties they can offer them.
                Therefore, they rather prefer to live in the future spectrum,
                the sensing people.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Furthermore, with intuition comes the imagination power and the
                creative ideas. As a result, intuition allows the people
                fantasize, imagine while also analyzing and questioning why
                certain things have happened that way and how they might most
                probably happen in the future as well. Therefore, those who
                prefer intuition tend not to live in the world created by the
                factual and the concrete facts like those who prefer sensing.
                Moreover, they are those who can gather facts by ‘reading
                between the lines’.
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>What it means to be Senseing:</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                Sensors use their five senses to take in information about the
                world around them. They start with the details and work towards
                the big picture. They are interested in what things are, and
                they use the information they gather to build on knowledge they
                already have. They try to make new information fit into their
                existing framework of understanding, like a new piece fitting
                into a partially-finished puzzle. They value what has worked in
                the past and they can sometimes be resistant to change.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                In sensing, a person pays more attention to things at present,
                or in other words, what he/she achieves from these five senses
                at that current moment. He or she also forms ideas and opinions
                based on that particular subjective experiences. Hence, they use
                this factual and realistic information to find solutions to the
                problems they face. People who use sensing over other are known
                as ‘sensors’, and they are considered more as literal thinkers
                who value realism and common sense of things. Therefore, they
                pay close attention to even the smallest detail they gather,
                while also been keen to note the inconsistencies within those
                details. Therefore, sensing allows them to pay more attention to
                their surroundings.

            <h1>Thinking and Feeling</h1>
            <h2>What it means to be Thinking : </h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                When presented with a decision, people with the Thinking trait
                typically lean on objective information. Knowledge is their
                indispensable tool. Once these personality types gather the
                facts, they test their alternatives against logic and reason to
                see which decision, by those standards, proves the most
                effective or realistic. They generally manage their
                relationships by employing fairness and effectiveness as their
                primary method of dealing with others. Their passions are born
                of respect.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Whatever value people with the Thinking personality trait place
                on relationships, they can still dismiss emotional responses,
                either their own or those of others. This is often because of
                their discomfort with emotions, which don’t always follow the
                rational path they value. Sometimes, emotions just puzzle them.
                But that doesn’t mean they have hearts of stone. They often feel
                in deep, profound ways – they would just rather not decide
                matters from that place. And, perhaps unfortunately, they may
                see those who do as weaker decision-makers.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Personality types with the Thinking trait are likely to evaluate
                things almost relentlessly. This isn’t as bad as it sounds. They
                aren’t satisfied if they believe something is not well thought
                out – they revel in the brilliance of an elegant plan. This
                makes them great to have around when critical thinking and
                impartiality of any kind is the focus, and this makes them
                immensely helpful for sorting out ideas and methods. Their
                primary filter is, “How does this help?”
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>What it means to be more Feeling:</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                People with the Feeling (F) trait follow their hearts and
                emotions – sometimes without even realizing it. They may show it
                to different degrees and in different ways, but however they do
                it, Feeling personality types tend to be caring, compassionate,
                and warm. These concerned people can be highly protective of
                those they care about – whether that is their immediate family
                or remote populations in need.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                Feeling personality types’ concern for others typically affects
                all their endeavors. This can be practical and close, as with
                family, friends, and colleagues. Or it can be broader, as with
                world peace, ending hunger, and giving the disadvantaged a
                boost.
              </ul>
              <ul>
                But this reliance on feelings doesn’t mean there is no logic –
                theirs is just a different logic. They see that emotions can’t
                simply be waved away, so feelings and the welfare of others
                shape their lives more than stark facts and cold objectivity.
                Weighing things this way makes these personalities valuable to
                have around when the big question is, “Who does this help?”

              <h2>What it means to be more Judging : </h2>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  Judgers approach life in a structured, organized and carefully
                  calibrated way, creating short- and long-term plans to help
                  them achieve their goals. Schedules and “to-do” lists are
                  comforting to them. They prefer knowing what they are getting
                  into and feel frustrated in situations of ambiguity and
                  change.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  People with this preference gain a sense of control by taking
                  charge of their environment. They are self-disciplined and
                  decisive, going for closure at the earliest possible
                  opportunity to avoid stress. Judgers have a “work first-play
                  later” mindset and struggle with open-ended plans. They would
                  rather come up with three different contingencies than deal
                  with problems as and when they arise.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  At work and in life, Judgers take their responsibilities and
                  deadlines very seriously. They are very specific about what
                  they need to get done, and they expect others to do as they
                  say. They can come across as domineering and inflexible, but
                  it’s all driven be a need to operate in a structured setting.
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h2>What it means to be more Percieving:</h2>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  Perceivers approach life and a freewheeling, spontaneous way,
                  preferring to keep their options open than make a clear plan
                  of action. They perceive structure as limiting and seek
                  flexibility in their lives. They like adapting to new
                  situations and feel frustrated by the daily grind of routines.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  People with this preference gain a sense of control by making
                  choices only when they are necessary. They view deadlines as
                  elastic, and often put off decision making until the last
                  possible moment so they can spend as much time as possible
                  exploring new options. They would rather start a new project
                  than close down an old one, as making a decision requires them
                  to commit to something that may well turn out to be the
                  inferior choice.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  At work and in life, Perceivers are relaxed and adaptable.
                  They enjoy life now and work later, and are always scanning
                  the horizon for new options and opportunities. They can come
                  across as unreliable and flaky, but it’s all driven by a need
                  to keep their options open.
